# Logo Assets

Place the official logo variations you received in this folder so the header can switch between them automatically.

Required file names:
- `logo-gold-white.png` – Gold icon with white lettering for dark/transparent headers.
- `logo-white.png` – Full white version (used as a fallback).
- `logo-gold-dark.png` – Gold icon with dark lettering for solid/light headers.

Once the images are here, the layout will reference them from `/assets/logo/`.
